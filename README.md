# AJAX App

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Earbuds Promotional Page assignment. It's a dynamic web page featuring an interactive model of earbuds. The page uses modern web technologies like SASS, AJAX, and the Fetch API to dynamically render content based on data retrieved from an API.

## Features

- **Interactive Hotspots**: Users can interact with hotspots on the earbud model to learn more about specific features.
- **Material Information**: Displays material information using the HTML template element.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a modern web browser to view the project.

## Branching Strategy
This project follows a feature-branch workflow:

- **master branch**: Contains the production-ready code.
- **development main branch**: For ongoing development.
- **feature branches**: For specific features or bug fixes (e.g., `feature-add-hotspots`, `fix-loading-spinner`).
